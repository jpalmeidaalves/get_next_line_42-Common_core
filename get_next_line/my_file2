2 1. Introduction
2 2. The Valgrind tool suite provides a number of debugging and profiling tools that help you make your programs faster and more correct. 
2 3. The most popular of these tools is called Memcheck. It can detect many memory-related errors that are common in C and C++ programs and that can lead to crashes and unpredictable behaviour.
2 4. 
2 5. The rest of this guide gives the minimum information you need to start detecting memory errors in your program with Memcheck. 
2 6. For full documentation of Memcheck and the other tools, please read the User Manual.

2 7. Preparing your program
2 8. Compile your program with -g to include debugging information so that Memcheck's error messages include exact line numbers. 
2 9. Using -O0 is also a good idea, if you can tolerate the slowdown. With -O1 line numbers in error messages can be inaccu.'\n'rate, although generally speaking running Memcheck on code compiled at -O1 works fairly well, and the speed improvement compared to running -O0 is quite significant. 
2 10. Use of -O2 and above is not recommended as Memcheck occasionally reports uninitialised-value errors which don't really exist.
